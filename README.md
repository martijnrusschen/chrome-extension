# Security Txt

The official Chrome extension for security.txt. This extension will automatically check every page you visit for a security.txt file. Currently it checks for the file in the root directory and in /.well-known/. 

The default icon for this extension is a grey circle. The circle turns red if no security.txt file is present and it turns green if there is one. You can view the security.txt file by clicking on the icon.
